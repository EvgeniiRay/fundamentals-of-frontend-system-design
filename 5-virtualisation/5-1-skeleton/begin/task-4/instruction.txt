/**
 * Part 4 - Creating element pool - Preparation phase
 *
 * 1. Create an array "pool" as a state variable

 * 2. Define "poolLimit" variable which is equal "pageSize * 2"

 * 3. Update #handleBottomObserver:

 *   - When pool size exceeds limit - push items [0, pageSize] to the end

 *   - Update items with a new method - updateData - it should cycle through elements that were moved
 *     and call the template update callback

 *   - Increase -start- counter by 1 since we moved to page + 1
