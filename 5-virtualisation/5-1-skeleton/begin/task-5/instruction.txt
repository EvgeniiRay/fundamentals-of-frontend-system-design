/**
 * Part 5 - Bottom Transitioning of updated elements
 *
 * 1. Move card elements to stacking context by rendering the as absolutely positioned items

 * 2. #virtual-list should become relative container for card elements

 * 3. Implement updateElement method for bottom recycling
 *   - it should cycle through all pool elements
 *   - Card (N + 1) should be assigned with Card(N) - y position
 *   - Use data-attributes to store positioning info

 *  4. Use CSS Transform to move elements down
